## Project Overview
- Deployed a cloud-based real-time image classification pipeline using Google Cloud VMs.
- Provisioned and configured three VMs: Kafka broker, image producer, and Spark Streaming consumer.
- Implemented a producer to stream one image at a time to a kafka topic.
- Built a Spark Streaming consumer to read the image data in real-time from the kafka topic and classify it using a pre-trained model from PyTorchâ€™s torchvision.
